                        <h2>Learn HTML5</h2>
                        <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth
                             and final[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium 
                             (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living 
                             Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology 
                             Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).

                            HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major 
                            update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the 
                            language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by
                             humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain 
                            backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]</p>
